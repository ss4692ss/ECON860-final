For the final, the dataset_final.csv is used for the factorial analysis. The token was expired, so token was created and I put the token inside .gitignore. I did factorial analysis by creating assignment.py. The results.csv file obtained after factorial analysis. After that I did linear and logistic regression. For linear I combined the two csvs (results.csv and dataset_final.csv) by making combinecsvs.py. I drop the unnecessary columns by using droppingunnecessarydata.py to obtain updated_data.csv. I found the accuracy score of 0.12 from linear regression. For logistic regression I make dummy.py to convert math score into 0 and 1 based upon math score>100 was considered 1 and math score<100 was considered 0. Due to this I got the accuracy score of 0.78 which is kind a nice otherwise before conversion top dummy it was very low around 0.04. Similarly, I did the Gaussian and k-mean to determine the different cluster. I found there were 4 groups and the better results were obtained from the Gaussian rather than the k-means.I made the plot by considering two factors like 1 and 2. Finally, I used the selected_question.py for the selection of the selection of questions based upon the requirement of the assignment. Hence, in this way i finalized the result.
